# 24.odin_mini_messageboard

[Task Description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board)

Since node application can't be deployed on GitHub, this project is local. 

Run 
```
node ./bin/www
```
to start the app.

In this project, I practice the Express basic I've already learned.

I learned a templating language: pug.

Find another good example from ![DutsAndrew](https://github.com/DutsAndrew/message-board)
